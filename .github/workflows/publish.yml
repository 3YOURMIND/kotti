      # HACK: When putting this workflow into action, the pipeline did not find the
      # correct registry and/or Auth Token. To fix this we did the following:
      # - adding both of these lines (we are not sure if only one would have done the trick)
      # - using `yarn publish` instead of `npm publish`
      - run: cp internals/scripts/source/npmrc-template /home/runner/work/_temp/.npmrc
      - run: cp internals/scripts/source/npmrc-template .npmrc
